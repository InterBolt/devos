# MacOS Install

Make sure to have the Bash version >= 3, Git, and Docker installed.

Download and run the install script to get started.

```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/InterBolt/solos/main/install/install.sh
bash ./install.sh
```

# Linux

It probably works the same as MacOS but it's not tested with the same rigor/frequency.

# Windows

I'm not gonna bother. But you can. After all, that's what this open-source thing is all about.
