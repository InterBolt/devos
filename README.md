To ensure that your bash terminal autocompletes all commands following a particular command, such as "pre", you can use the `complete` command in bash to define custom completion behavior. This involves creating a function that handles the completion logic and then associating this function with your prefix command using the `complete` command.

Here's a step-by-step guide based on the information from the sources:

1. **Define a Completion Function**: First, you need to define a function that will handle the completion logic. This function will be responsible for suggesting completions based on the current input.

2. **Use the `complete` Command**: Once you have your completion function, you can use the `complete` command to associate this function with your prefix command. This tells bash to use your custom completion function whenever the prefix command is used.

Here's an example based on the information from Source 0 and Source 1:

```bash
# Define a completion function for the 'pre' command
_pre_completion() {
    # Check if the current word index is greater than or equal to 1
    ((COMP_CWORD >= 1)) || return
    # Extract the subcommand from the current word list
    local subcommand="${COMP_WORDS[2]}"
    # If the current word index is 1, it means the user is typing the subcommand
    if ((COMP_CWORD == 1)); then
        # Generate completions for subcommands
        COMPREPLY=( $(compgen -W 'touch cp ls' -- "$subcommand") )
    else
        # For other cases, you can define more specific completions
        # This is a placeholder for more complex logic
        COMPREPLY=( $(compgen -W 'arg1 arg2 arg3' -- "${COMP_WORDS[COMP_CWORD]}") )
    fi
}

# Associate the completion function with the 'pre' command
complete -F _pre_completion pre
```

In this example, the `_pre_completion` function is defined to handle completions for the `pre` command. It checks if the user is typing a subcommand (e.g., `touch`, `cp`, `ls`) after `pre` and generates completions accordingly. You can customize the completions by modifying the `-W` option in the `compgen` command.

After defining this function and associating it with the `pre` command using `complete -F _pre_completion pre`, bash will use this function to provide autocompletion suggestions when you type `pre` followed by a space and then press the Tab key.

Remember, this is a basic example. Depending on your specific needs, you might need to adjust the completion logic, especially if you have a large number of subcommands or if the subcommands themselves require autocompletion.
