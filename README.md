# SolOS

To understand SolOS, let's consider the following two fictional characters (and the worlds they live in): 

- Joel - from [Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338013/)
- Truman - from [The Truman Show](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120382/).

For which character would an AI prove more helpful?

Or if that still doesn't make sense, consider the saying: your dog probably knows you better than your closest friend.

**SolOS is the dev environment that you and your AI never have to leave.**

## Install Guides

### MacOS

Make sure to have the Bash version >= 3, Git, and Docker installed.

Download and run the install script to get started.

```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/InterBolt/solos/main/install/install.sh
bash ./install.sh
```

### Linux

It probably works the same as MacOS but it's not tested with the same rigor/frequency.

### Windows

I'm not gonna bother. But you can. After all, that's what this open-source thing is all about.
