# SolOS

To understand SolOS, let's consider the following two fictional characters (and the worlds they live in): 

- Joel - from [Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338013/)
- Truman - from [The Truman Show](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120382/).

For which character would an AI prove more helpful?

## MacOS Install

Make sure to have the Bash version >= 3, Git, and Docker installed.

Download and run the install script to get started.

```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/InterBolt/solos/main/install/install.sh
bash ./install.sh
```

## Linux

It probably works the same as MacOS but it's not tested with the same rigor/frequency.

## Windows

I'm not gonna bother. But you can. After all, that's what this open-source thing is all about.
