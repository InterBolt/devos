# DAEMON DEBUGGING NOTES:

- [ ] the configure phase is wiping clean the pre-existing solos.config.json files

# TODOS

- [ ] add the "app" command to the shell and use the dev/artifact code as reference.
- [ ] add support for daemon reload --foreground which will kill the current daemon and start a new one in the foreground for better debugging visibility.
- [ ] test daemon
